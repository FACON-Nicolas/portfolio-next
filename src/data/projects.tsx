        introduction: `This SaaS for pizzerias was started in July 2023, it was firstly just for a pizzeria called Da Adamo.
        Now, many restaurants are waiting a first version of my software.
        
        Why are they interested ?
        
        Because it will be cheap (â‚¬900 / year for maintenance and updates), and it will be customizable as they want.`,
